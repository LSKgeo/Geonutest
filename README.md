# GEONU
Geoneutrinos are subatomic, fundamental particles that are produced by the radioactive -decay of Heat Producing Elements (HPEs) within the Earth’s interior. Geoscientists are particularly interested in the abundance and distribution of geoneutrinos produced by uranium (U), thorium (Th), and potassium (K) because they are long-lived radionuclides, preserving a record of Earth’s core-mantle thermal evolution. \

This repository hosts the work-in-progress development environment for a user-friendly version of the code used to calculate geoneutrino flux. Each section of the .mlx main GEONU file contains description and explanation, and some also have interactive controls for changing model input values.

# Version
## v0_2
This version will run standard geoneutrino flux calculations to completion for one of six detectors (Borexino, KamLAND, SNO+, JUNO, CJPL, and Hawaii). The "Visualizing the Results" section has not yet been developed. The code has been mildly optimized but will likely incorporate more changes to its subfunctions in the future.

# UX Feedback Form
We are collecting feedback on the usability of this program here: https://forms.gle/rDo22zKzBWCxtKSW9 \
This form will be updated with more specific questions in the near future.
